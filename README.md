&emsp First of all, I am sorry. The purpose of this data set is to share data with my teammates. I donâ€™t know if it will be open to everyone and will be noticed. Now that the game is over, I am happy if you want to train through this data set, so write some instructions about this project now. Unfortunately, I only have a training set and no test set here, so if this means that the data set doesn't make sense, please let me know. I would like to apologize to anyone who follows this data and if disclose such a data set was infringed in Kaggle, please let me know, please, thank you!

These datasets are from a competition called CCF BDCI. A Chinese Company called Jolly Chic provides its data to the competition. Paragraph below is the description of the project. In order to enhance the user logistics service experience, the supply chain cooperates to prepare the goods in advance in the local warehouses in various markets around the world, reducing the logistics timelines and improving the user logistics service experience. Different from the domestic e-commerce logistics situation, the production and sales areas of the e-commerce business are global, the procurement of goods, transportation, customs inspection, etc., the entire commodity preparation link takes a long time. Under the background of the rapid development of big data and artificial intelligence technology, using big data analysis and algorithm technology to accurately predict the long-term commodity sales, provide data foundation for the supply chain, and provide technical support for the global supply chain solution of the sea-going enterprises.
